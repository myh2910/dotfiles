These are the dotfiles for [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc).
It's obviously mostly meant for personal use in keeping my dotfiles
synced across all my operating systems.
But I figured it might be helpful to others who are looking for ideas
of what kind of configuration options are out there,
ideas for software to try out, and so on.

I (Evan) have the following allegiances:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) as Linux distribution
* [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as window manager
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org) as a text editor
	* [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a package manager
* [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) as TeX distribution
* [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as a shell
	* [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) as a Fish package manager

Keybindings are optimized for [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard).
